# random-password
This project contains code for Challenge Three of the UofT Coding Bootcamp. 
It involves using Javascript to create a random password generator. The app should ask the user the desired length of password and which characters the
user wants to include (number, uppercase, lowercase, special) and then generates a random password.
The completed code is then deployed through GitHub.
